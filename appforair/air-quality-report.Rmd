## Introduction

This report describes the development of an interactive Shiny app that visualizes PM2.5 air pollution levels across countries.

## Data

The dataset contains PM2.5 concentration levels from 2010â€“2019 by country, sourced from OpenAQ.

## App Features

- Dropdown to select a country
- Time-series plot of PM2.5 values
- Interactive map to select cities and auto-update the graph
- Linear and smoothed trendlines

## Implementation Notes

- Built using `shiny`, `ggplot2`, and `leaflet`
- Data cleaned and loaded from CSV using `read.csv()`
